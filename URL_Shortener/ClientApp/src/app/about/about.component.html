  Here i tried to implement UrlShortening algorithm with loging features. This is my first ever project with Angular. I didnt figure out how to implement login features
  that worked in ASP.NET Core with Angular. I also made an attempt to make an shortening algorithm based on API, but stayed with basic demonstrational algo.
